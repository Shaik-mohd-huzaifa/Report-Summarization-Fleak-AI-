## How did the Workflow invoked and where?

- The workflow is deployed on fleak.ai and it is invoked using __API Endpoint__
- We are calling the Endpoint in our react client app.
- Code for API Endpoint calling
## Function for API Endpoint Calling
```js
export const summarizeReports = async (file_id, language, summary_type) =>
  await fetch(
    "https://data.fleak.ai/api/v1/events/8b867f22-6bb5-468b-ad6b-08ed7d19e3a3/prod", // WorkFlow API endpoint
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "api-key": import.meta.env.FLEAK_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify([
        {
          file_id:
                file_id,
          language: language,
          summary_type: summary_type,
        },
      ]),
    },
  )
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => data.outputEvents[0].choices[0].message.content)
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));

```

## React Component where the function is called 
  ```js
  const handleSubmission = async () => {
    try {
      const upload = await pinata.upload.file(selectedFile);
      const file_id = upload.cid; // Use 'const' for the variable
      console.log("File Uploaded, Summarizating....");
      const data = await summarizeReports(
        file_id,
        inputData.language,
        inputData.summary_type,
      ); // Await the async call
      setSummary(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  ```

This is a Vite React application that utilizes environment variables for configuration. The project is set up to use the following environment variables:

- `FLEAK_API_KEY`
- `VITE_PINATA_JWT`
- `VITE_GATEWAY_URL`

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/Shaik-mohd-huzaifa/Report-Summarization-Fleak-AI-)
   cd Report Summarization Fleak AI/client

2. **Install dependencies**

   Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   ```env
   # .env
   FLEAK_API_KEY=your_fleak_api_key_value
   VITE_PINATA_JWT=your_vite_pinata_jwt_value
   VITE_GATEWAY_URL=your_vite_gateway_url_value
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your_fleak_api_key_value`, `your_vite_pinata_jwt_value`, and `your_vite_gateway_url_value` with your actual values.

4. **Run the development server**

   Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the project for production.
- `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`: Locally preview the production build.

## Using Environment Variables in the Code

In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the code. For example:

```javascript
// src/config.js
export const FLEAK_API_KEY = import.meta.env.FLEAK_API_KEY;
export const VITE_PINATA_JWT = import.meta.env.VITE_PINATA_JWT;
export const VITE_GATEWAY_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_GATEWAY_URL;
```

You can then use these variables anywhere in your React components.

## Build for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder.

## Deployment

After building the project, you can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting service, such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
